 <p> I've wanted to learn Salesforce since I first read about the company and it's tech. I truly believe Salesforce is in my professional future, and I want to prove that by learning as much as I can about it so that one day I can be a part of the company itself. This GitHub account marks all of my progress as a data analyst, coder, and all around student of the tech industry, so my Trailhead adventures should be a part of it as well. As I earn badges and work on projects, I will document my progress here. I will also provide the link to my Trailhead account so that my badges can be cross validated and confirmed if need be. I plan to make this something of a game though I know I will be busy working on multiple projects at a time. Wish me luck! </p>
